# OnlineBarbershopManagementSystem

## Abstract
The online Barbershop Management system can be used by customers to book their appointments online, without having to go to the actual shop.

This system is enabled by the internet which connects all the Barbershops in a particular area and the customers.

As per this system, the customer visits the website, browses through the various shops in desired areas, prices and services available in various shops and selects and book the appointment of service he or she needs.

These appointments will then be confirmed by the shop owners  and the respective slots will be booked for the respective customer.
